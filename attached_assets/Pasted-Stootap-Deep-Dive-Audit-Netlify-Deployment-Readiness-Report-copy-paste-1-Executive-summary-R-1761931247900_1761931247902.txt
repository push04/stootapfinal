Stootap — Deep-Dive Audit & Netlify Deployment Readiness Report (copy-paste)
1) Executive summary

Root cause of Netlify failures: Netlify does not run a long-lived Node/Express server. Express apps must be deployed as Netlify Functions (serverless). Attempting to “start” an HTTP server on Netlify will fail. 
docs.netlify.com
answers.netlify.com

What needs to change:

Wrap the existing Express app as a Netlify Function (or migrate endpoints into Functions).

Provide a netlify.toml that sets the publish directory for the built frontend and the functions directory for the backend.

Ensure all required environment variables are set on Netlify (database, session secret, admin credentials, optional Razorpay/OpenRouter).

Fix module path aliasing (e.g., @shared/...) so the server build resolves correctly in a serverless bundle.

Use database-backed storage in production (the in-memory storage is not suitable for serverless).

Limitations to account for: Netlify Functions have execution/memory constraints; plan APIs accordingly.

2) Why it’s not deploying to Netlify (diagnosis)

Trying to run Express directly on Netlify.

Netlify doesn’t host a persistent Node server; backend code must run as Functions. Netlify’s own guide states Express “works” on Netlify because of Netlify Functions (i.e., as serverless). 
docs.netlify.com

A Netlify Support guide reiterates: you cannot run your own server/database directly on Netlify.

Missing or incomplete Netlify configuration.

Without netlify.toml, Netlify won’t know where your frontend build output (publish dir) and functions live. That leads to 404s or failed deploy behavior.

Server bundle & module resolution issues.

Use of TypeScript path aliases like @shared/... can cause “module not found” in serverless bundles unless the bundler (and/or tsconfig paths) is mirrored in the build tooling for functions.

Any ESM/CJS mismatch or “directory import” assumptions can also cause build-time errors in the functions bundle.

Environment variables not present at build/runtime.

Missing SESSION_SECRET, DATABASE_URL (or the Supabase pooler creds), ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH, etc., will break startup and/or admin auth in production.

Stateful/in-memory pieces.

Any in-memory storage (caches, carts, temp stores) will be ephemeral on serverless—each function invocation is isolated. Production must use the database-backed implementations.

Webhook/raw body handling.

Payment webhooks (e.g., Razorpay) that require the raw request body must be adapted to Netlify Functions semantics (no direct express.raw() unless wrapped correctly).

Database connection strategy.

Use a serverless-friendly connection (Supabase/Neon poolers). Incorrect connection strings (or missing sslmode=require) cause connection errors during function execution.

Function/route pathing.

After moving Express into a Function, your API lives under /.netlify/functions/<name> (unless you add redirects/rewrites). Frontend fetch URLs must be adjusted accordingly.

Function limits unaccounted for.

Cold starts, timeouts, and memory constraints apply to Express-on-functions and should guide payload sizes, heavy processing, and long DB operations.

3) Concrete fixes to make the current codebase deployable on Netlify (no code, step-by-step wording)
A) Backend: adapt Express to Netlify Functions

Wrap your existing Express app using a Netlify adapter for Express, producing a single function handler that Netlify can invoke.

Place the compiled handler into your Functions directory (see section 4C).

Ensure any middleware that needs raw bodies (e.g., payment webhooks) is set up using an approach compatible with Netlify Functions.

Audit all routes and confirm they’re mounted under the function path.

Update frontend API calls to point to /.netlify/functions/<your-function>/<endpoint> (or add redirects so /api/* rewrites to the function).

B) Storage & state

Disable all in-memory stores for production. Use the database-backed storage implementation everywhere (carts, orders, leads, notifications, etc.).

Confirm all SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE paths point to the database layer, not to in-memory fallbacks.

C) Module resolution & build system

Remove or resolve all TS path aliases (e.g., @shared/...). Either replace with relative imports or configure the bundler and TypeScript paths so the build for functions resolves them correctly.

Ensure the server build outputs one handler per function and does not attempt to start a long-lived server.

Check for ESM/CJS mismatches or “directory import” assumptions; they must be compatible with the Node version/functions runtime on Netlify.

D) Environment variables (must be set in Netlify UI)

Required:

DATABASE_URL (serverless/postgres pooler; include SSL mode as required)

SESSION_SECRET (long, random secret)

ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH (never use defaults)

Optional depending on features:

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET (if payments are enabled)

OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_BASE_URL (if AI concierge is enabled)

Put them in Site settings → Environment variables before deploying.

E) Webhooks & security

Verify webhook secrets and raw body verification logic with your Function handler.

Enforce secure cookies, CORS rules, and no default admin credentials in production.

4) Netlify deployment plan (end-to-end)
A) Prerequisites

A serverless-friendly Postgres (Supabase/Neon) with a verified connection string.

Schema applied (e.g., via Supabase SQL editor/migrations).

Admin credentials chosen and hashed beforehand (no defaults).

B) Repository preparation

Add a Netlify configuration that:

Sets the publish directory to your built frontend.

Sets the functions directory to where your serverless build outputs Express-as-a-function.

(Optional) Adds caching headers for assets and basic security headers.

Move/convert the Express server to a Netlify Function handler.

Replace or resolve TS path aliases used by the server code.

Ensure frontend fetch requests target the function path (or add redirects).

C) Netlify settings

In the site’s settings:

Build command: your build script that produces both the frontend assets and the function handler bundle.

Publish directory: the folder containing built static assets (the Vite build output).

Functions directory: the folder containing the built function bundle.

Environment variables: add all required ones (Section 3D).

D) Deploy and verify

Connect the GitHub repo in Netlify → trigger a deploy.

After deploy:

Load the site root to verify static assets load.

Hit a few API endpoints via /.netlify/functions/<name>/... (or your rewrites) to confirm JSON responses and DB connectivity.

Test admin login, create/read orders, cart flow, and (if enabled) Razorpay test payments.

E) Known constraints & trade-offs

Express on Netlify works via Functions, not a dedicated Node server. 
docs.netlify.com

All function limitations apply (timeout/memory). Design API handlers for quick execution and avoid heavy synchronous work. 
docs.netlify.com

5) Security hardening (production)

Replace default admin credentials. Generate and set a strong ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH; rotate regularly.

Long random SESSION_SECRET. Minimum 32+ bytes.

HTTP security headers: frame options, content type options, referrer policy; add strict CSP if feasible.

Limit PII exposure: audit logs and responses for accidental leakage.

Rate limiting & DoS resilience: especially for auth and payment endpoints.

Webhook signing: verify signatures on payment webhooks before processing.

6) API & data integrity improvements

DB-first validation: enforce constraints at the DB layer (FKs, unique indexes) and mirror with runtime validation.

Idempotency keys: for order creation and payment callbacks to prevent duplicates.

Pagination & filtering: for admin lists (orders, leads) to keep responses small in functions.

Audit trail completeness: ensure all state-changing actions write audit logs.

7) Frontend improvements for serverless compatibility

Absolute API base: set a single source of truth for the API base path that points to your Netlify Function endpoint (or use rewrites).

Graceful failures: standardized error toasts and retry logic for transient 5xx from cold starts.

Static asset optimization: image compression and long-cache headers for assets.

8) Observability & QA

Function logs: monitor via Netlify UI/CLI to catch runtime errors and timeouts.

Synthetics: ping health endpoints and a smoke-script that adds/removes a cart item.

Error tracking: integrate a client/server error tracker compatible with serverless.

Load tests (short bursts): verify you stay below function limits with DB poolers.

9) Performance guidance for Netlify Functions

Keep handlers lean: avoid heavy synchronous work. Offload long tasks to background jobs off-platform if needed.

Use connection poolers (Supabase/Neon) and reuse connections when the runtime is warm.

Cache safe data at the edge (CDN for static, consider edge functions for read-only endpoints if needed).
