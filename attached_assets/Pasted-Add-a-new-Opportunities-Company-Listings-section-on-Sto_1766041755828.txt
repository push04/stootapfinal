Add a new “Opportunities & Company Listings” section on Stootap.com where companies can register, pay to list, post paid/unpaid internships and roles, and students/candidates can apply. Requirements, flows and copy are below — ready to hand to a developer/designer or to paste into a product ticket.

Feature overview (one-sentence)
Allow companies to create accounts, register their business, and post featured internship/paid roles; candidates can browse, choose a featured company, and apply with their CV and details. Companies pay a listing fee after a 2-month trial and the platform charges a small processing/feature fee for paid opportunities.

Trial/listing: New company listings are live for a 2-month trial (free).


Post-trial subscription: After trial, company must pay ₹4,999 / year to keep the listing active and featured.


Paid opportunity platform fee: For each paid role posted, Stootap charges ₹199 per job (covers 6 months visibility) as a platform processing/feature fee.


Optional add-ons: Featured banner, priority placement, email blast, candidate shortlist — billed separately.
