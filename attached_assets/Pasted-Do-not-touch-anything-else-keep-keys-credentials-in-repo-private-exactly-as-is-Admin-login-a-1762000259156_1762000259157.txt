Do not touch anything else; keep keys/credentials in-repo (private) exactly as-is.


Admin login → auto-redirect to /admin/dashboard (else /profile); support ?next= and avoid flicker while role loads.


Remember intended admin URL when blocked; replay it post-login and clear after landing.


Dashboard shell: sticky left-nav, breadcrumbs, quick actions; persist collapse; hide admin-only items for non-admins.


KPI cards (Revenue/Active Users/Conversions/Errors) with time window; click → filtered detail + CSV + “copy link with filters.”


Global filters & search (date/owner/status); save presets; URL reflects filters; one-click reset.


Bulk actions with confirm/undo; show progress; idempotent; audit every change.


RBAC: enforce on server; UI hides/greys forbidden actions with “Why disabled?” tooltip.


Audit trail: who/what/when/where + deltas + reason; filterable, exportable, with backlinks.


Safe impersonation (“View as”) with banner/time-limit/auto-revert; block high-risk actions while active.


Moderation queues: priority/age/owner/status, keyboard triage, SLAs and escalation paths.


Notifications: in-app bell + optional digests; per-user mute/snooze, schedule, and deep links.


Feature flags/experiments: gate panels by role/tenant; flighting + A/B tied to KPIs; one-click rollback.


Settings guardrails: validate/preview/test-connection; dangerous saves require re-auth + reason + audit.


Performance/resilience: virtualized tables, incremental fetch, optimistic UI; widget-level error + retry (no page crash).


Accessibility/keyboard: full shortcuts, ARIA, high contrast, live regions; no focus traps; SR-friendly toasts.


I18n/locale: user time zone + date/number formats; dictionary-based copy; basic RTL checks.


Export/import: scoped exports respect filters/roles; background jobs; validation preview + partial-success + rollback.


Security nudge: show admin banner “Repo contains secrets—keep private by policy”; block accidental secret display (do not move/alter stored keys).
