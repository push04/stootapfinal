# Replit AI Build Spec — **Stootap v2**

**Focus:** crystal‑clear features, polished design, and complete auth pages (Login, Register, Profile, 404).
**Deploy:** GitHub → Netlify (I’ll supply credentials).
**Integrations:** Supabase (Auth + DB + Storage), Razorpay (payments), OpenRouter (AI), Netlify Forms (lead capture backup).

---

## 0) What to Build

Create a production‑ready web app **Stootap** that helps students and businesses launch and grow in India. Ship a frictionless catalog → cart → Razorpay checkout, AI concierge for guidance, lead capture via forms, and a tidy dashboard. Deliver a professional, unique, **sleek** UI with **dark & light** modes, **micro‑interactions**, **glass overlays**, and **elevated shadows**.

**Use EXACT hero/nav copy:**

* **Logo:** `Stootap`
* **Navigation:** `For Students | For Businesses | Login | Sign Up`
* **H1:** `Your Entire Business, Handled.`
* **H2:** `From idea to IMPACT. From concept to running brand. 300+ services. One platform.`
* **CTAs:** `Student? Get Started` → `/students`, `Business? Explore Services` → `/services`

---

## 1) Tech + Hosting

* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript (Netlify Next Runtime)
* **UI:** Tailwind CSS + **shadcn/ui** + **Lucide** icons
* **Animations:** Framer Motion (page, section, and hover micro‑interactions)
* **State/Data:** React Query for client fetching; Next Server Actions for simple writes
* **DB/Auth/Storage:** Supabase
* **Payments:** Razorpay (Checkout + Orders API + Webhooks)
* **AI:** OpenRouter (streamed chat + function calling)
* **Forms:** Netlify Forms (backup capture); primary flow writes to Supabase
* **Testing:** Vitest/RTL + Playwright smoke
* **Analytics (optional):** Netlify Analytics or Plausible via env flag

**Netlify**: add `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` in `netlify.toml`. Prefer Next route handlers; keep Functions for webhooks if desired.

```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["razorpay"]
```

**ENV (set in Netlify UI):**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS=off|netlify|plausible
```

## 2) Feature Checklist (Ship all)

1. **Service Catalog & Detail**

## 3) UX & Design Polish (Dark/Light + Motion)

**Design Personality:** premium, calm, confident. Minimal noise, high clarity.

**Fonts:** Inter Variable (text) + Plus Jakarta Sans (headings) — self‑host, preload, fallbacks.

**Color Tokens:**

* `bg`: slate‑950 (dark), slate‑50 (light)
* `text`: slate‑100/300 (dark), slate‑900/600 (light)
* `primary`: indigo‑600/700; `accent`: emerald‑500/600
* `surface`: slate‑900/100 with glass overlays using `backdrop-blur-md` + 6–12% white/black alpha

**Elevation & Glass:**

* Cards: `rounded-2xl` + `shadow-xl` (light) / `shadow-2xl` (dark subtle) + `backdrop-blur` glass on hero/nav.

**Motion (Framer Motion):**

* Page transition: fade+rise `duration:0.35s` `ease:[0.22,1,0.36,1]`
* Card hover: scale 1.02 + shadow intensify; button hover: `y:-1px` + subtle glow
* Staggered list reveal for service grids (40ms per item)
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Micro‑interactions:**

* Focus rings visible (outline + offset), tooltips on icons, skeleton loaders (shimmer) for cards, toast confirmations on actions.

**Components to Polish:**

* `Button` (primary, secondary, ghost), `Input`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Toast`, `Skeleton`, `Pagination`, `DataTable` (for Admin)

**Imagery:** royalty‑free, compressed **WebP/AVIF**, descriptive ALT text. Category banners with subtle gradient + glass label.

**Accessibility:** semantic landmarks, aria labels, keyboard traps avoided, contrast AA, logical tab order.

**Performance Budgets:** LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, JS < 300KB initial (gz). Optimize images, code‑split routes, cache fonts.

* `profiles(id, full_name, phone, role, created_at)` (FK → auth.users)
* `categories(id, slug, name, description, sort_order, created_at)`
* `services(id, category_id, slug, name, summary, long_description, base_price_inr, sku, eta_days, icon, active, created_at)`
* `orders(id, user_id, status, subtotal_inr, gst_inr, total_inr, razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature, created_at)`
* `order_items(id, order_id, service_id, name, unit_price_inr, qty, total_inr, created_at)`

* `leads(id, user_id, kind, message, captured_via, metadata, created_at)`
* `documents(id, user_id, order_id, name, url, kind, created_at)`

## 6) API Endpoints (Next route handlers or Netlify Functions)

* `POST /api/razorpay/order` → create Razorpay order + draft DB order
* `POST /api/razorpay/verify` → verify signature → mark paid
* `POST /api/razorpay/webhook` → verify header signature → store `webhook_events` → reconcile
* `POST /api/forms/lead` → validate (Zod) → insert into `leads` (+ Netlify Forms hidden backup)
* `POST /api/ai/concierge` → OpenRouter stream; function calls to insert leads & compose bundles

**Security:** input validation (Zod), anti‑spam honeypot on forms, basic rate‑limit, CSRF tokens for non‑GET forms.

---

## 7) Testing (must include)

* **Unit (Vitest):** tax calc, totals, Razorpay HMAC verify
* **E2E (Playwright):** browse → add to cart → test payment (Razorpay test key) → webhook simulate → order success; submit lead form → row appears in `leads`

---

## 8) SEO, Accessibility, Content

* Meta titles/description per page, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, JSON‑LD Product on service detail
* Aria labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast AA, motion reduction
