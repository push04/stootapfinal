# Replit AI Build Spec — **Stootap v2**

**Focus:** crystal‑clear features, polished design, and complete auth pages (Login, Register, Profile, 404).
**Deploy:** GitHub → Netlify (I’ll supply credentials).
**Integrations:** Supabase (Auth + DB + Storage), Razorpay (payments), OpenRouter (AI), Netlify Forms (lead capture backup).

---

## 0) What to Build

Create a production‑ready web app **Stootap** that helps students and businesses launch and grow in India. Ship a frictionless catalog → cart → Razorpay checkout, AI concierge for guidance, lead capture via forms, and a tidy dashboard. Deliver a professional, unique, **sleek** UI with **dark & light** modes, **micro‑interactions**, **glass overlays**, and **elevated shadows**.

**Use EXACT hero/nav copy:**

* **Logo:** `Stootap`
* **Navigation:** `For Students | For Businesses | Login | Sign Up`
* **H1:** `Your Entire Business, Handled.`
* **H2:** `From idea to IMPACT. From concept to running brand. 300+ services. One platform.`
* **CTAs:** `Student? Get Started` → `/students`, `Business? Explore Services` → `/services`

---

## 1) Tech + Hosting

* **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript (Netlify Next Runtime)
* **UI:** Tailwind CSS + **shadcn/ui** + **Lucide** icons
* **Animations:** Framer Motion (page, section, and hover micro‑interactions)
* **State/Data:** React Query for client fetching; Next Server Actions for simple writes
* **DB/Auth/Storage:** Supabase
* **Payments:** Razorpay (Checkout + Orders API + Webhooks)
* **AI:** OpenRouter (streamed chat + function calling)
* **Forms:** Netlify Forms (backup capture); primary flow writes to Supabase
* **Testing:** Vitest/RTL + Playwright smoke
* **Analytics (optional):** Netlify Analytics or Plausible via env flag

**Netlify**: add `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` in `netlify.toml`. Prefer Next route handlers; keep Functions for webhooks if desired.

```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
  external_node_modules = ["razorpay"]
```

**ENV (set in Netlify UI):**

## 3) UX & Design Polish (Dark/Light + Motion)

**Motion (Framer Motion):**

* Page transition: fade+rise `duration:0.35s` `ease:[0.22,1,0.36,1]`
* Card hover: scale 1.02 + shadow intensify; button hover: `y:-1px` + subtle glow
* Staggered list reveal for service grids (40ms per item)

Use the following (same as v1) and enable RLS with owner‑only select on user‑owned rows:

* `profiles(id, full_name, phone, role, created_at)` (FK → auth.users)
* `categories(id, slug, name, description, sort_order, created_at)`

* `orders(id, user_id, status, subtotal_inr, gst_inr, total_inr, razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature, created_at)`
* `order_items(id, order_id, service_id, name, unit_price_inr, qty, total_inr, created_at)`
* `webhook_events(id, source, event_type, payload, created_at)`
* `leads(id, user_id, kind, message, captured_via, metadata, created_at)`
* `documents(id, user_id, order_id, name, url, kind, created_at)`
* `funding_opportunities(...)`, `posts(...)`

Seed **categories/services** from the catalog at the end of this doc. Each service: summary, bullet long_description (3–5 bullets), ETA, base price, icon.

## 8) SEO, Accessibility, Content

* Meta titles/description per page, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, JSON‑LD Product on service detail
