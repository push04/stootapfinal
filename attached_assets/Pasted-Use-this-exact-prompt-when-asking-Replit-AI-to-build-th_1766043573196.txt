Use this exact prompt when asking Replit AI to build the feature. It’s written to be copy-pasted — complete, explicit, and developer-friendly while still readable by a non-technical product person. I reviewed Stootap’s site and its services pages to match UI tone and scope.

SHORT INSTRUCTION (one line you can paste first)

Build a polished “Opportunities & Company Listings” section on Stootap.com where companies can register/login, post internships & paid roles, run a 2-month free listing that converts to a ₹4,999/year featured subscription, and where candidates can view companies, apply with CVs, and track applications. Paid job posts require a ₹199 platform fee for 6 months visibility.

CONTEXT & DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Keep UI consistent with Stootap’s current look and tone (simple, professional, business-oriented). 
Stootap

Prioritize usability: short forms, clear labels, clear next steps for both companies and applicants.

Make optional fields truly optional (GSTIN, registration docs). Only collect sensitive info (bank details) with explicit consent.

Build for India-first payments and rules (₹ amounts); design flows so integrations (Razorpay/Stripe) can be plugged in later.

PRIMARY GOALS (what success looks like)

Companies can register, login, and manage a company profile.

Companies can post internships, experience roles, part-time/full-time, and paid roles.

Company listings are active for a 2-month free trial, then require ₹4,999/year to remain featured.

Paid roles automatically require a ₹199 platform fee at posting time for 6 months visibility.

Candidates can browse companies, select featured companies, apply with CV and profile data, and track application status.

Admin can moderate listings, verify companies, view payments, and remove suspicious listings.

HIGH-LEVEL USER TYPES

Company Admin — registers company, posts roles, views applicants, pays to renew/feature.

Candidate / Student — browses jobs, applies with CV, tracks status.

Site Admin — verifies companies, views revenue, disables listings, resolves disputes.

Job posted (paid) subject: “Paid job live — ₹199 charged”

PRIVACY & SAFETY (must implement in product behavior)

Make GSTIN and registration docs optional. Do not require them to post jobs.

Collect bank details only with explicit consent and for legitimate paid roles. Store such details securely. (Flag in UI that bank details are optional and used only for payroll.)

CV downloads should be logged (who downloaded what and when).

Provide candidate ability to remove their data (GDPR/IT rules style), or request export/delete.

Warn and block obvious malware uploads (max file size and allowed extensions).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA — TESTABLE ITEMS

Company registers; after first job post, trial_end_date = posted_date + 60 days.

System sends trial reminder emails at 14d, 7d, 1d before trial_end_date.

If company posts a paid job, platform fee ₹199 is charged at posting and job gets 6 months “featured_until”.

After trial expires and ₹4,999/year not paid after 7-day grace, company loses featured privileges.

Candidate submits application, company receives notification and can download CV.

Admin can verify or disable company; when disabled, company jobs are hidden in public listings.

EDGE CASES & QA SCENARIOS (include these tests)

Company edits job to toggle Paid → ensure additional ₹199 charge applied only if toggled to Paid and not already paid for the job.

Company deletes job that had a paid ₹199 — decide and document refund policy (recommended: non-refundable after job goes live).

Candidate withdraws application → company notified.

Company posts many jobs during trial → trial still counts only from first job post.

Company attempts to post Featured role after trial expired → show renew now message and block featured selection.

DELIVERY (what to hand over)

Ask Replit AI to deliver:

A clickable design prototype or clean UI mockups for: company register, company dashboard, job posting form, job listing page, job detail + apply modal, candidate dashboard, admin panel.

A list of exact form fields and data validation rules (no code required if you want non-technical).

An implementation plan (stepwise) or a single package ready to hand to your dev team: includes copy for UI, email templates, sample test cases above, and acceptance criteria.

A short README with how to test flows manually (trial expiry, paid job posting, apply flow).

UI & COPY GUIDELINES (tone + microcopy)

Use short CTA buttons: “Post a Role”, “Apply with CV”, “Renew Listing”, “Feature this Job”.

Labels: Mark optional fields with “(optional)”.

Show money clearly: e.g., “Listing renewal: ₹4,999 / year” and “Paid job platform fee: ₹199 (6 months visibility)”.

Feature badges: “Featured”, “Paid opportunity”, “Flexible hours”, “Remote”.

SAMPLE DATA (copy-paste for QA)

Company: “Acme EdTech” — Business type: education — GSTIN: (leave blank).
Job (paid): “Frontend Intern” — Paid: Yes — Salary: “₹8,000–12,000” — Posted today → expect ₹199 charge, job visible & shows “Featured until [date + 6 months]”.
Candidate: “Asha Kumar”, email, phone, CV uploaded → apply to job → company receives notification.

EXACT PROMPT BLOCK (copy & paste this last)

Build a full Opportunities & Company Listings module for Stootap.com that includes: company registration/login with optional GSTIN/docs and a 2-month free listing trial; job posting (internship, paid/unpaid, flexible hours); paid job platform fee ₹199 for 6 months visibility (charged at posting); company featured subscription ₹4,999/year after trial; candidate apply flow with CV upload and optional bank details (with consent); company & candidate dashboards; admin moderation tools; email reminders and invoice notifications; and strict privacy behavior (optional docs, secure handling of bank details).
