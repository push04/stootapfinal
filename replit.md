## Recent Changes (November 1, 2025)

### Latest Updates - Admin Dashboard & Profile Enhancements
- **Simplified Admin Authentication:** Changed admin authentication from SHA-256 hashing to plain text password comparison (username: admin, password: @Stootap123) for easier access to private site
- **Enhanced Profile Page:** 
  - Added tabbed interface with Personal Info, My Orders, and Security sections
  - Implemented logout functionality with button in header
  - Improved visual design with gradient avatar backgrounds
  - Added member information and notification preferences display
  - Created placeholder for future order history
- **Admin Dashboard Settings Tab:**
  - Added new Settings tab to admin dashboard for checking API integration status
  - Created `/api/admin/integration-status` endpoint to verify Razorpay, OpenRouter, and Supabase credentials
  - Visual status indicators showing which services are properly configured
  - Real-time refresh capability to re-check integration status
- **Fixed Supabase Client Configuration:** Updated client-side Supabase initialization to handle missing VITE_PUBLIC environment variables gracefully with placeholder values
- **Workflow Configuration:** Set up dev-server workflow on port 5000 with webview output type for Replit preview

### Replit Environment Setup
- Successfully imported project from GitHub and configured for Replit environment
- Installed all Node.js dependencies and resolved TypeScript configuration
- Set up Supabase database connection using SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Pushed database schema using Drizzle ORM and seeded with initial data (8 categories, 50+ services)
- Configured workflow for development server running on port 5000 with Vite HMR

### Netlify Serverless Deployment Configuration
- Built and verified Netlify serverless functions for production deployment
- Configured `netlify/functions/api.ts` for main API routing using serverless-http
- Configured `netlify/functions/razorpay-webhook.ts` for payment webhook handling
- Set up build process with `build-functions.js` using esbuild for function bundling
- Configured deployment with autoscale target for optimal Netlify serverless performance
- All API endpoints properly configured to work as serverless functions
- Fixed TypeScript type declarations for Buffer in rawBody
- Verified build artifacts: dist/public (frontend) and netlify-functions-build (serverless functions)
- Created comprehensive deployment guide: `REPLIT_TO_NETLIFY_GUIDE.md`
- **Fixed netlify.toml:** Added SPA fallback redirect (`/*` â†’ `/index.html`) to handle client-side routes on refresh
- Removed redundant Razorpay webhook redirect (webhook handled by main API function at `/api/payment/webhook`)

### User Authentication Implementation
- **Added passwordHash field** to profiles schema for secure credential storage
- **Implemented authentication endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - Creates user profile and stores password hash
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - Verifies credentials and establishes session
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Clears user session
  - `GET /api/me` - Returns current user profile (401 if not authenticated)
- **Fixed Login.tsx and Register.tsx:** Updated to use `useLocation` from wouter for proper navigation, redirect to `/profile` after success
- **Created protected Profile.tsx:** Fetches `/api/me`, shows auth prompt if not logged in, displays user data when authenticated
- Password hashing uses SHA-256 (matches existing admin auth pattern; consider upgrading to bcrypt/argon2 for production)

### API Keys and Secrets
- RAZORPAY_KEY_ID and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET configured for payment processing
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY configured for AI concierge functionality using DeepSeek model
- SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY configured for database access
- SUPABASE_ANON_KEY configured for client-side operations
- SESSION_SECRET required for production deployment (Netlify environment variable)
- All secrets properly stored in Replit environment variables

### Verified Functionality
- All major pages loading correctly: Home, Services, Login, Register, Admin Login, Profile
- API endpoints tested and working: Categories, Services, Cart, Payment, AI Concierge, User Auth
- Admin dashboard with authentication protection (redirects to login when not authenticated)
- User registration and login flows working with session management
- Protected profile route shows login prompt when not authenticated
- Vite development server with HMR running on port 5000 with proxy support
- Frontend configured with `allowedHosts: true` for Replit preview proxy
- Database successfully seeded with sample data

### Known Limitations
- Admin authentication uses plain text password comparison (by design for private site access)
- Client-side Supabase integration uses placeholder values when VITE_PUBLIC_ environment variables are not set (backend handles all database operations)
- No rate limiting on login attempts (should add for production)
- No email verification flow (registration is immediate)
- User authentication via Supabase Auth is configured but requires frontend environment variable setup for full functionality

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** for development and bundling. **Wouter** handles client-side routing, and **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** provides a custom, premium design system. **TanStack React Query** manages server state and data fetching, while **React Context** handles UI theme and shopping cart state. Key features include responsive navigation, a service catalog with filtering, detailed service pages, a shopping cart, and user authentication flows.

### Backend Architecture

The backend utilizes **Express.js** with **TypeScript**, following a RESTful API design. It supports development with Vite's HMR and serves static files in production. API endpoints manage categories, services, leads, cart operations, and orders. Business logic includes in-memory storage (with an interface for future database migration), automatic database seeding, session-based cart management, and Zod for form validation. The application is designed for serverless deployment using Netlify Functions.

### Data Storage Solutions

**PostgreSQL** via Neon Database serves as the primary data store, with **Drizzle ORM** providing type-safe queries and schema management. The database schema includes tables for profiles, categories, services, orders, order items, leads, and cart items. Key design decisions include UUID primary keys, decimal types for monetary values, JSONB for flexible data storage, and timestamp tracking.

### Authentication and Authorization

Frontend authentication pages are implemented using **React Hook Form** and **Zod** for validation. The system is designed to integrate with **Supabase Auth** for full authentication, email verification, and role-based access control (student/business user types).
